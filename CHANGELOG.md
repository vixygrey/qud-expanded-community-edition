# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This changelog begins at the fork. Upstream history through 2.2 is Mura's and is preserved
verbatim in [`docs/2.2-changelog.txt`](docs/2.2-changelog.txt) — it is a historical record and is
never edited.

Entries marked **(internal)** do not affect the shipped mod and are invisible to players. They are
recorded because contributors need them, not because subscribers do.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing has been released yet. Everything below lands in the fork's first Workshop release.

> ⚠️ **The first release requires a new character.** Body-part and anatomy identifiers changed
> (see *Changed* below), and those are written into save state. This fork publishes as a separate
> Workshop item, so no existing save is affected — but a save started against a pre-release build
> of this fork will not carry forward.

### Changed

- **The chip slot is now `Chip Interface`** (was `Chipset Interface`). The slot holds 108 chips
  against 36 chipsets, so it was named after the minority item; a chipset is a set of chips, so
  the new name is accurate for the whole catalogue. `Psionic Interface` — the name Mura's
  documentation used — was rejected because 13 of the 36 mutations these chips grant are physical
  rather than mental, and because the slot exists on every humanoid rather than only on Psionic
  Adepts. ([#13](https://github.com/vixygrey/qud-expanded-community-edition/issues/13))
- **The Psionic Adept anatomy and body object are now `PsionicAdept`** (was `Yttrian`, a leftover
  from before the genotype was renamed). Follows the convention already set by True Kin →
  `TrueKin`: the display name with spaces removed.
  ([#13](https://github.com/vixygrey/qud-expanded-community-edition/issues/13))

### Added

- **(internal)** `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md` — naming, layout, XML and C# formatting, and Steam Workshop
  requirements. §1 records which identifiers are safe to rename and which are load-bearing.
  ([#16](https://github.com/vixygrey/qud-expanded-community-edition/issues/16))
- **(internal)** `CLAUDE.md` — the fork charter: compatibility, causality, credit, DX, safety, and
  configurability, plus the contribution workflow.
- **(internal)** `docs/FEATURES.md` — complete feature reference reconstructed from source: 350
  new blueprints, 209 vanilla merges, and a severity-ranked defect checklist.
- **(internal)** `docs/PERMISSION.md` — fork permission, provenance, and credit obligations.
- **(internal)** This changelog.

### Fixed

- Nothing yet. The inherited defect backlog is tracked in
  [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md) §10 and in the issue tracker.

### Internal

- **Repository restructured** so the shipped mod is isolated in `mod/`, with documentation in
  `docs/` and tooling at the repo root. Development files were previously destined to ship to
  every subscriber — measured across 87 installed mods, 8 ship a `README.md`, 5 a `LICENSE` and 4
  a `.csproj` by accident. ([#15](https://github.com/vixygrey/qud-expanded-community-edition/issues/15))
- **Spaces removed from blueprint filenames** — `MeleeWeapons.xml`, `OtherEquipment.xml`,
  `PsionicChips.xml`, `RangedWeapons.xml`. Safe because Qud resolves modded XML by root element
  rather than by filename.
- Repository placed under version control with the pristine upstream 2.2 import tagged
  `upstream-2.2`, so `git diff upstream-2.2` always shows exactly what the fork changed.

## Credits

Every release carries the credit list in [`docs/PERMISSION.md`](docs/PERMISSION.md) §4 —
**Mura** (`@mura_raven`) for the original mod, and **Noble Lark** for the psionic subtype sprites,
named explicitly as the one condition of the fork permission.
